# Polymer Patch Bundle
This is a patch for [blockus](https://modrinth.com/mod/blockus), [cinderscapes](https://modrinth.com/mod/cinderscapes), [terrestria](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrestria), [traverse](https://modrinth.com/mod/traverse) and [woods_and_mires](https://github.com/KiloCraft/WoodsAndMires), making them work fully server side, with all of their functionality intact.

The original mods are required *(the mod will only patch mods that are installed)* and not included within this mod.

This mod requires server resource pack, about which setup you can read here: https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/
